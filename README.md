# Mobile Cross-Platform demo

This is my project for [Khan Academy's 2015 Healthy Hackathon](http://healthyhackathon.khanacademy.org)

It illustrates how to use shared `C++` code in iOS and Android, using:
- [Djinni](https://github.com/dropbox/djinni)
- Android Studio 1.3
- Gradle 2.5 with experimental NDK support
- Xcode 6.4

Note that the repo does not include a sample iOS project because I integrated this in Khan Academy's iOS app, which is not open source (yet).
